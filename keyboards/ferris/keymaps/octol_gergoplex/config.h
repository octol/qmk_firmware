// If you press a dual-function modifier key (such as "Ctrl when held, Z when tapped"),
// press another key (such as "X"), release the modifier key, and then release the normal
// key, it would normally output the modded key ("Ctrl+X" in this case)... [Ignore mod
// tap] makes sure that both keys are sent (eg "zx") unless both keys are held for the
// Tapping Term.
#define IGNORE_MOD_TAP_INTERRUPT

// Normally if you press a Mod Tap key, tap another key (press and release) and then release the
// Mod Tap key, all within the tapping term, it will output the tapping function for both
// keys. This changes it to output the mod.
//#define PERMISSIVE_HOLD

// When the user holds a key after tapping it, the tapping function is repeated by
// default, rather than activating the hold function. This allows keeping the ability to
// auto-repeat the tapping function of a dual-role key. TAPPING_FORCE_HOLD removes that
// ability to let the user activate the hold function instead, in the case of holding the
// dual-role key after having tapped it.
//#define TAPPING_FORCE_HOLD

// Holding and releasing a dual function key without pressing another key will result in
// nothing happening. With retro tapping enabled, releasing the key without pressing
// another will send the original keycode even if it is outside the tapping term.

// Copied mouse settings from Pierre's default Ferris layout

// Set the mouse settings to a comfortable speed/accuracy trade-off,
// assuming a screen refresh rate of 60 Htz or higher
// The default is 50. This makes the mouse ~3 times faster and more accurate

// give it more time to accelerate to max speed to retain precise control over short distances.
